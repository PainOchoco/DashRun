# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí® DashRun

![DashRun Preview](./assets/preview.png)

DashRun is an endless arcade platformer game where you play as a runner and aim to survive the longest.

It was made for a school project by Lilian Scicluna and Matteo Planchet aka PainOchoco.

It is written in Python with the library Pygame. It was a school project but i'm planning on improving it (maybe a multiplayer feature?).

## üéÆ How to play

The game is only available on Windows for the moment.

1. Download the DashRun.zip in the latest release
2. Extract it
3. Execute main.exe
4. Check controls right below

## üïπ Controls

I didn't have time to implement a menu system, so here are the controls (it was made for french keyboards).
